    <p>I am having <em>so much</em> fun coding in HTML. I just learned that Git is important for developers to keep track of their changes <br>
        and different versions. I'm also writing this in <strong>VSCODE</strong>, which is the best code editor you can use. <br>
        I love computer science.
